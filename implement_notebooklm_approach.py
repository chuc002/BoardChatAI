(a) seventy-five percent (75%) if the application is made within the first year following resignation;
(b) fifty percent (50%) if the application is made within the second year following resignation; 
(c) twenty-five percent (25%) if the application is made within the third year following resignation; and
(d) no reduction if the application is made after the expiration of three years following resignation.

If such Application is approved by the Board for Social membership, the initiation fee is equal to the Social initiation fee then in effect but reduced by the same percentages and timeframes as set forth above. The Member must also pay all accrued capital dues for the applicable membership category from the date of resignation to the date of reinstatement and any other fees, charges or assessments which may be owed to the Club.
